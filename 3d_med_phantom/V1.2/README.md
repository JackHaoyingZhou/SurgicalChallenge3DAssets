# Phantom 1.2 notes
SRC assets scaled to actual dimensions.

## Running instructions.

Download the `high_res` and `low_res` folders 
<https://livejohnshopkins.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Surgicalroboticschallenge/Shared%20Documents/General/AMBF_assets/3d_med/3d_med_v1.2?csf=1&web=1&e=8XaynA>

and add them to root directory.

Then, run simulation with the `./run_env.sh` script. Blender files are included in onedrive link.


## Problems.

* Zooming is very hard
* Collision sphere size is hard coded. It looks gigantic compared to phantom.
* Entry holes are vibrating badly.
